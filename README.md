# Estimands-versus-algorithms-for-competing-events
This repository contains R code for reproducing the results of the working paper: "Illustrating implications of misaligned questions and statistics with
competing events and interest in treatment mechanism"

### Figures

- **Figure 3** — Generated by `IdentitySlippage_ad=0.R`
- **Figure 4** — Generated by `NonIdError.R`
- **Figure 5** — Generated by `ProstateAnalysis.R`, using `prostate.csv`
- **Figure A1** — Generated by `IdentitySlippage_ad=1.R`

### Simulation Results (Tables 1, 2, A2, A3)

- Each of `simmult1.R` to `simmult6.R` defines a simulation scenario.
- These scripts call `sim_function.R` to run 20,000 iterations and output a `.csv` file of the results.
- The resulting `.csv` files are aggregated by `createTable_20250407.R` to produce the final tables.
